# hotkeyman
Simple tool to manage your hotkeys under *Windows* and under *X11* based desktops like *Gnome* or *KDE*.

## General Information
hotkeyman -- short for "*Hotkey-Manager*"  
The Windows version uses the Windows-API function `RegisterHotKey()` to register user-defined hotkeys.  
For X11 systems the *xhklib* library is used to define hotkeys.
More information on this library: [github.com/jwmcode/xhklib](https://github.com/jwmcode/xhklib).  
The user is able to define his own hotkeys and their desired effect. More on that in the *Configuration*-section.

## Installation
### Windows
Simply put a link-file (\*.lnk) to the hotkeyman-binary in your auto-start directory. Usually this directory is located under `C:\Users\[Your_User]\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Window s\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`.  
During the next boot of windows *hotkeyman* will automatically start and manage your defined hotkeys.
### GNU/Linux (GNOME-like DE's)
Create a .desktop-file and put it in the following directory: `/home/<user>/.config/autostart`  
The .desktop-file should execute the hotkeyman-binary.  
For more information on how to write a .desktop-file visit the following website: [gnome.org](https://developer.gnome.org/integration-guide/stable/desktop-files.html.en).

## Configuration
You will find a configuration-file called `hotkeyman.conf` in the root directory of *hotkeyman*. It already contains an example of how to define your own hotkeys:  
`cmd="start calc.exe" keys="1 2 0 C";`  
**IMPORTANT:** If you are using GNU/Linux or Unix you should add an ampersand at the end of the command! For instance:  
`cmd="gnome-calculator &" keys="1 2 0 C";`  
Every hotkey-definition contains two key-value pairs.
- **cmd**: The command that will be executed when the hotkey is triggered.
- **keys**: The keys that represent the hotkey
	- Values are delimited with spaces.
    - The first three digits are used to define key-modifiers.
    	- **1** stands for [ALT]
    	- **2** stands for [CTRL]
    	- **4** stands for [SHIFT]
    	- **8** stands for [WINDOWS-KEY / META-KEY]
    	- **0** means that this modifier is not used
        	- For example: Write `keys="0 0 0 C"` defines the hotkey [C].
            - Whereas `keys="1 2 0 C"` defines the hotkey [ALT]+[CTRL]+[C]
    	- For more information take a look at [this](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646309%28v=vs.85%29.aspx).
	- The last character represents the key that is pressed.
  
All together, the example above defines a hotkey 'C' with the modifier-keys [CTRL] and [ALT]. When the hotkey is triggered, the windows-calculator is started.  
Note the semicolon ';' at the end of the example line. It tells the *hotkeyman* that it's the end of the current hotkey definition. This allows you to spread the hotkey-definition over various lines:  
`cmd="start calc.exe"`  
`keys="1 2 0 C";`  
After each semicolon a new hotkey-definition can follow.

## Building *hotkeyman*
Use the existing *Makefile* to build the *hotkeyman*-binary. Type  
`make` or `make debug` to build a debug-version  
`make release` to build a release-version.
### GNU/Linux
In order to build *hotkeyman* you need to download *xhklib* from [github.com/jwmcode/xhklib](https://github.com/jwmcode/xhklib).  
The referenced repository contains two files that you have to put into the root directory of *hotkeyman*:  
- xhklib.h
- xhklib.c

Once you have copied the files into the *hotkeyman* directory you should be able to build *hotkeyman*.
### Differences between build targets under Windows
- The debug-build will show a console-window and various debug-messages during the run-time of *hotkeyman*.
- For the relase-build there is only a log-file called `hotkeyman.log` available to view debug-messages. The *hotkeyman*-process runs in the background without any graphical properties.
